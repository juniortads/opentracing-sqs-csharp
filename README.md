# opentracing-sqs-csharp

A simple C# library for instrumentation of [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs) messages 
with [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/).

## Dependencies

* NET Core 3.1 
* AWSSDK.SQS 3.3.102.54
* OpenTracing

## Installation

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EventBus.Sqs.Tracing/):

    > dotnet add package EventBus.Sqs

    > dotnet add package EventBus.Sqs.Tracing

## Getting started

**Before**, in your application's _Startup.cs_ file, configure OpenTracing first.
```cs
using OpenTracing.Util;
...
services.AddSingleton(serviceProvider =>
{
    var loggerFactory = new LoggerFactory();

    var config = Jaeger.Configuration.FromEnv(loggerFactory);
    var tracer = config.GetTracer();

    if (!GlobalTracer.IsRegistered())
        GlobalTracer.Register(tracer);

    return tracer;
});
```
#### Check this link for more information about Jaeger configuration via environment.
https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-csharp

**Next**, configure EventBus.Sqs with tracing: 
```cs
using EventBus.Sqs.Configuration;
using EventBus.Sqs.Tracing.Configuration;
...
services.AddEventBusSQS(Configuration)
        .AddOpenTracing();
```
### Configure health checks for SQS
```cs
services.AddHealthChecks()
        .AddSqsCheck<HereAddYourIntegrationEvent>();
```
**Finally**, We can using in your application's _Controller.cs_ file, Check below this example:
```cs
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IEventBus eventBus;
    public WeatherForecastController(IEventBus eventBus)
    {
        this.eventBus = eventBus;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<ActionResult> Create()
    {
        var rng = new Random();
        //Create sample Integration Event
        var weatherInEvent = new WeatherInEvent(Guid.NewGuid().ToString(), "Freezing");

        await eventBus.Enqueue(weatherInEvent);

        return Accepted();
    }
}
```
**Don't forget**, Creating your Integration event:
```cs
public class WeatherInEvent : IntegrationEvent
{
    public string WeatherEventId { get; set; }
    public string Summary { get; set; }

    public WeatherInEvent(string id, string summary) : base(id, DateTime.UtcNow)
    {
        WeatherEventId = id;
        Summary = summary;
    }
}
```
